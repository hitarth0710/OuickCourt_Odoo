- ✅ Enhanced user authentication checks

## Key Components Modified

### BookingPage (`booking_page.dart`)
- Enhanced booking data preparation with better validation
- Improved price calculation logic
- Added comprehensive error handling and user feedback
- Added debug logging for troubleshooting

### Profile Page (`profile_page.dart`)
- Added pull-to-refresh functionality
- Enhanced booking display with better data parsing
- Added automatic refresh mechanisms
- Added debug/test section for development

### Firestore Service (`firestore_service.dart`)
- Enhanced `createBooking()` method with verification
- Improved `getUserBookings()` with better debugging
- Added new methods: `updateBookingStatus()`, `cancelBooking()`, `getBookingById()`
- Added comprehensive error logging

## Database Structure

### Bookings Collection
```json
{
  "user_id": "string",
  "venue_id": "string",
  "venue_name": "string",
  "venue_location": "string", 
  "venue_image": "string",
  "sport": "string",
  "court_id": "string",
  "court_name": "string",
  "booking_date": "ISO8601 string",
  "start_time": "HH:MM format",
  "end_time": "HH:MM format", 
  "duration_hours": "number",
  "price_per_hour": "number",
  "total_amount": "number",
  "status": "confirmed|cancelled|completed",
  "payment_status": "paid|pending|refunded",
  "booking_id": "QB{timestamp}",
  "user_name": "string",
  "user_email": "string",
  "user_phone": "string",
  "notes": "string",
  "created_at": "Firestore timestamp",
  "updated_at": "Firestore timestamp"
}
```

## Testing the Implementation

### Manual Testing Steps
1. **Login**: Ensure user is authenticated
2. **Navigate to Venue**: Choose any venue from home page
3. **Book Court**: Complete all booking steps
4. **Verify Booking**: Check profile page bookings tab
5. **Pull to Refresh**: Test refresh functionality in profile

### Debug Features
- Added debug buttons in profile page for development
- Console logging for booking operations
- Enhanced error messages for troubleshooting

### Firestore Rules Required
Make sure your Firestore security rules allow:
```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    // Allow authenticated users to read/write their own bookings
    match /bookings/{bookingId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && 
        (resource == null || resource.data.user_id == request.auth.uid);
    }
    
    // Allow authenticated users to read venues and sports
    match /venues/{venueId} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null;
    }
    
    match /sports/{sportId} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null;
    }
  }
}
```

## Next Steps

1. **Remove Debug Code**: Remove debug sections before production
2. **Add Booking Cancellation**: Implement cancel booking functionality
3. **Add Booking History**: Filter bookings by status
4. **Enhanced Validation**: Add more comprehensive booking validation
5. **Offline Support**: Add offline booking support with sync

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Bookings not showing**: Check Firestore rules and user authentication
2. **Permission denied**: Verify Firebase authentication and rules
3. **Price calculation errors**: Check venue data structure
4. **Court names showing as IDs**: Verify court data structure

### Debug Commands
- Use "Debug Info" button in profile page to see current bookings
- Check console output for detailed logging
- Use "Refresh Bookings" button to manually reload data

## Support
